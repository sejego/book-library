# Fancy Pantsy JavaScript Library

## Description

This is a JS project done as a part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).
The books are stored in user's browser's local storage (if present) and all entries are saved. In this project, I also tried Almond.css for the first time, it is quite simple to use and makes simple websites look more modern.
